      <p>The best way I can describe it is like this: say you head down to Ben and Jerry's with the idea that you wanted ice cream. 
        Traffic is backed up so it takes awhile, but you don't care, you know that sweet, savory treat will be well worth it. 
        At last you park outside of the store, walk inside and recieve a cheery "How can I help you today sir?". 
        Only to realize at that very moment.. you'd rather have a cookie. Now in no way am I saying that good ol B&J's isn't worth the trip, they're great actually, but only at what they do best, which in this case, is ice cream.
        Now I'm trapped with a dillema, do I leave with nothing, having wasted my time, and proceed to spend even more of it finding my way to the nearest Tollhouse Cookie store?
        Or should I settle with the closest thing they have.. cookie dough ice cream? A little of what I want, surrounded by much of what I don't.</p>
        <p>If this analogy makes little to no sense, then let me explain in a more literal one.</p>
